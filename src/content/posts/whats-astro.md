If you're like me and just starting your journey into web development, you've probably come across the term "Static Site Generator" (SSG). But what exactly is it?

A Static Site Generator is a tool that builds HTML pages from templates and content (like Markdown or JSON). Unlike traditional sites that generate pages on the fly with a backend server, static sites are pre-rendered. This means faster load times, better performance, and improved security.

So, why Astro? Astro is a modern SSG that makes building static websites easy, fun, and fast. Its standout features include:
- Island architecture (loads only necessary JavaScript)
- Framework-agnostic (works with React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- Markdown and MDX support
- Built-in image optimization
