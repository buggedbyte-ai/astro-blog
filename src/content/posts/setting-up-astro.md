Ready to dive in? Let’s set up our first Astro project.

1. **Install Node.js** if you haven’t already. Use [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Initialize your project**:
```bash
npm create astro@latest
```
3. Choose a template (I recommend "blog" for starters).
4. Navigate into your new project folder:
```bash
cd my-astro-site
```
5. Start the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You now have a live development environment running at `http://localhost:4321`!
