You built your site, now letâ€™s share it with the world!

Astro works great with many hosts. One of the easiest is [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/):

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Sign into Netlify and link your repo.
3. Set build command to `npm run build` and publish directory to `dist/`.

Other options:
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/)

Once deployed, you get a live URL for your site.
